      "aaset description:  The image features a highly imaginative and whimsical scene that blends elements of fantasy and traditional culture. Central to the composition is a figure standing next to a  tree that is adorned with greenery and other fantastical elements, suggesting it might hold special significance or powers. The figure next to the tree is engaging with it in some manner, likely indicating an interaction of cultural or celebratory nature. On one side of the scene, a small boar adds to the magical quality of the scene by its mere presence, suggesting this could be a nocturnal setting. Further enriching the scene, a boar is depicted in motion, contributing to the dynamic and somewhat surreal atmosphere. The entire depiction feels like a page out of a fairy tale or folk story, possibly aiming to convey themes of harmony with nature, celebration of life, or exploration of mystical traditions.\n",

We can see a juvenile dragon perched on one of the many fairie balancing stones that the fairies build to meditate upon. In the sky we can see the planet Oberrhyon orbits, Vahaluria. The fairies usually meditate on the full moon but are surreptitiously absent this full moon so the dragons have all taken their place. Perhaps the fairies are more present than we realise when we look closer and see a mischievous cat tempting fate by trying to swat at the dragon's tail. What else is a cat to do but play with such a toy that is willingly presented to it?\n",

Here and there, in many different ways. Some you could say even look like quilts. (Obviously not this one....LOL)   I also like to take away the dramatic way the white of the paper has a way of outshining the whole piece.  That's when I use water color the most to shade it a bit. Believe me that is a work in progress and a technique that is ever evolving .  \n",

Central to the composition is a figure standing next to a  tree that is adorned with greenery and other fantastical elements, suggesting it might hold special significance or powers. The figure next to the tree is engaging with it in some manner, likely indicating an interaction of cultural or celebratory nature. On one side of the scene, a small boar adds to the magical quality of the scene by its mere presence, suggesting this could be a nocturnal setting. Further enriching the scene, a boar is depicted in motion, contributing to the dynamic and somewhat surreal atmosphere.

Central to the composition is a figure standing next to a  tree that is adorned with greenery and other fantastical elements, suggesting it might hold special significance or powers. The figure next to the tree is engaging with it in some manner, likely indicating an interaction of cultural or celebratory nature. On one side of the scene, a small boar adds to the magical quality of the scene by its mere presence, suggesting this could be a nocturnal setting. Further enriching the scene, a boar is depicted in motion, contributing to the dynamic and somewhat surreal atmosphere. The entire depiction feels like a page out of a fairy tale or folk story, possibly aiming to convey themes of harmony with nature, celebration of life, or exploration of mystical traditions.\n",

The fairies usually meditate on the full moon but are surreptitiously absent this full moon so the dragons have all taken their place. Perhaps the fairies are more present than we realise when we look closer and see a mischievous cat tempting fate by trying to swat at the dragon's tail. What else is a cat to do but play with such a toy that is willingly presented to it?\n",

      "aaset description:  The image features a highly imaginative and whimsical scene that blends elements of fantasy and traditional culture. Central to the composition is a figure standing next to a  tree that is adorned with greenery and other fantastical elements, suggesting it might hold special significance or powers. The figure next to the tree is engaging with it in some manner, likely indicating an interaction of cultural or celebratory nature. On one side of the scene, a small boar adds to the magical quality of the scene by its mere presence, suggesting this could be a nocturnal setting. Further enriching the scene, a boar is depicted in motion, contributing to the dynamic and somewhat surreal atmosphere. The entire depiction feels like a page out of a fairy tale or folk story, possibly aiming to convey themes of harmony with nature, celebration of life, or exploration of mystical traditions.\n",

We can see a juvenile dragon perched on one of the many fairie balancing stones that the fairies build to meditate upon. In the sky we can see the planet Oberrhyon orbits, Vahaluria. The fairies usually meditate on the full moon but are surreptitiously absent this full moon so the dragons have all taken their place. Perhaps the fairies are more present than we realise when we look closer and see a mischievous cat tempting fate by trying to swat at the dragon's tail. What else is a cat to do but play with such a toy that is willingly presented to it?\n",

Here and there, in many different ways. Some you could say even look like quilts. (Obviously not this one....LOL)   I also like to take away the dramatic way the white of the paper has a way of outshining the whole piece.  That's when I use water color the most to shade it a bit.
